Resolving dependencies...
Error: cabal.exe: Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: Bricksbreak-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
[__1] unknown package: wav (dependency of Bricksbreak)
[__1] fail (backjumping, conflict set: Bricksbreak, wav)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: Bricksbreak, wav
